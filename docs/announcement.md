The PSST Challenge is a collaboration between Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) and Portland State University (PSU). Our proposed activities will be supported via a grant from the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders NIH (R01-DC015999-04S1), the purpose of which is to promote the use of clinical datasets of aphasic speech by the mainstream machine learning community, and which includes travel support for participating students.
